## integer multiplication

Integer multipliction using Karasuba algorithm. See [here](./integer_multiplication)

## median maintenance

Keep tracking the median of a streamed integer with a complexity of O(log(i)), where i is the number of integers arrived. See [here](./median_maintenance) 

## inversion_count

See [here](./inversion_count)

## sorting and selection

* rSort() -- random sort -- O(nlog(n))
* quickSort() -- random sort using median-of-three as pivot -- O(nlog(n))
* heapSort() -- O(nlog(n))
* mergeSort() -- O(nlog(n))
* rSelect() -- random selection, both in place and out of place -- O(n)
* m3Select() -- random selection using median-of-three as pivot -- O(n)
