## integer multiplication

Integer multipliction using Karasuba algorithm. See [here](./integer_multiplication)

## median maintenance

Keep tracking the median of a streamed integer with a complexity of O(log(i)), where i is the number of integers arrived. See [here](./median_maintenance) 

## inversion_count

See [here](./inversion_count)

## sorting and selection

* rSort() -- random sort -- O(nlog(n))
* quickSort() -- random sort using median-of-three as pivot -- O(nlog(n))
* heapSort() -- O(nlog(n))
* rSelect() -- random selection, both in place and out of place -- O(n)
* m3Select9) -- random selection using median-of-three as pivot -- O(n)

See [here](./sorting_and_selection)

## graph

* adjacency list representation of directed and undirected graph
* Depth first search (DFS)
* Breath first search (BFS)
* Karger's random algorithm
* Kosaraju's algorithm
* Dijkstra's algorithm

See [here](./graph)

## hash table

* a relatively large 2-sum problem

See [here](./hash_table)
